    "# Module 2 - Build RAG-powered Q&A Application with **RetrieveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code and step-by-step instructions for building a fully-managed question-answering (Q&A) application using a **RetrieveAndGenerate API** of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we demonstrated how to create a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock — including setting up an S3 data source, configuring an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) vector index, and ingesting documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take the next step: building a Q&A application that can query that Knowledge Base using the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API. This API allows you to retrieve the most relevant content from your Knowledge Base based on a user’s query and automatically pass that information to a foundation model (FM) to generate a grounded, context-aware response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of the RAG pattern — where external data is dynamically retrieved at query time and incorporated into the model’s prompt to improve relevance, accuracy, and transparency. In this solution, retrieved knowledge base content comes with source attribution, helping end users understand the origin of the response and minimizing the risk of model hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Fully-managed RAG with **RetreiveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieveAndGenerate` API provides a fully managed way to implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a query, the API automatically converts the query into vector embeddings, performs a similarity search against the Knowledge Base, and retrieves the most relevant document chunks. These search results are then injected into the foundation model's prompt as additional context, enabling the model to generate more accurate and grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-turn conversations, Knowledge Bases also maintain short-term conversational memory — allowing the API to return more contextually relevant answers across a dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **generated response** from the foundation model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source attribution** metadata for the retrieved content\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **actual retrieved text chunks** from the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to build RAG-powered applications with trusted, explainable answers — without having to manage retrieval pipelines or prompt construction yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Retrieve and Generate Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now see the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API in action and showcase a fully managed RAG workflow in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’ll use the Knowledge Base built in the previous lab — containing Amazon Shareholder Letters — to demonstrate how the API retrieves relevant information and generates a grounded response to a user query."

So, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I\\u2019m proud of the incredible commitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I\\u2019m not sure any of us would have gottenthrough the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams during this period, and I\\u2019m eternally grateful.     It\\u2019s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It\\u2019s because we weren\\u2019t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we\\u2019re constantly experimenting and inventing. We\\u2019re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they\\u2019re our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers\\u2019 lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf.     People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody\\u2019s head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto\\u2014you have a new invention that\\u2019s a breakaway success for a long time. That\\u2019s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time.     Let me give you some Amazon examples.     Our Fulfillment Network: Going back to the pandemic, there\\u2019s no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We\\u2019d been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment.\",\n",

We are happy to have them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new jobs become available. We\\u2019ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newark airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool teacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9th and now helps manage new inventory. We\\u2019re happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.     Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We\\u2019ve removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we\\u2019ve suspended more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.     Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power\\u2014whether for vital healthcare work, to help students continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home\\u2014is critical in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities in their efforts to end this pandemic.     We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients.\",\n",

The list of what we\\u2019ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS in general) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customers much more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), but also allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.     Devices: Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated industrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold), but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (now millions) in 60 seconds\\u2014and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, we launched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and a gyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences). The phone was unsuccessful, and though we determined we were probably too late to this party and directed these resources elsewhere, we hired some fantastic long-term builders and learned valuable lessons from this failure that have served us well in devices like Echo and FireTV.     When I think of the first Echo device\\u2014and what Alexa could do for customers at that point\\u2014it was noteworthy, yet so much less capable than what\\u2019s possible today. Today, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices out there (in homes, offices, cars, hotel rooms, Amazon Echo devices, and third-party manufacturer devices); you can listen to music\\u2014or watch videos now; you can control your lights and home automation; you can create routines like \\u201cStart My Day\\u201d where Alexa tells you the weather, your estimated commute time based on current traffic, then plays the news; you can easily order retail items on Amazon; you can get general or customized news, updates on sporting events and related stats\\u2014and we\\u2019re still quite early with respect to what Alexa and Alexa-related devices will do for customers.\",\n",

So, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I\\u2019m proud of the incredible commitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I\\u2019m not sure any of us would have gottenthrough the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams during this period, and I\\u2019m eternally grateful.     It\\u2019s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It\\u2019s because we weren\\u2019t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we\\u2019re constantly experimenting and inventing. We\\u2019re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they\\u2019re our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers\\u2019 lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf.     People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody\\u2019s head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto\\u2014you have a new invention that\\u2019s a breakaway success for a long time. That\\u2019s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time.     Let me give you some Amazon examples.     Our Fulfillment Network: Going back to the pandemic, there\\u2019s no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We\\u2019d been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment.\",\n",

    "We demonstrated how this API simplifies the RAG workflow by automatically retrieving relevant content from a knowledge base and generating grounded, context-aware responses using a foundation model. The responses also include source references, allowing users to easily trace answers back to the original documents.\n",

    "If you are looking for more flexibility and control over your RAG workflow, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases also provides a `Retrieve` API. This API allows you to perform semantic and/or keyword search over your knowledge base and retrieve the most relevant document chunks, which you can then use to build custom prompts or workflows tailored to your application needs.\n",
